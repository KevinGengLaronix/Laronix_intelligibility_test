ATR_01,ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO COULDN'T MAKE UP HIS MIND
ATR_02,WHENEVER THE OTHER RATS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT HUNTING WITH THEM HE WOULD ANSWER IN A SOFT VOICE I DON'T KNOW. 
ATR_03,AND WHEN THEY SAID WOULD YOU RATHER STAY INSIDE HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER. 
ATR_04,HE'D ALWAYS AVOID MAKING A CHOICE
ATR_05,ONE FINE DAY HIS AUNT ZELDA APPEALED TO HIM NOW LOOK HERE
ATR_06,NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE ABOUT YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
ATR_07,YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND OF YOUR OWN THAN A GREASY OLD BLADE OF GRASS 
ATR_08,ARTHUR COUGHED AND LOOKED WISE AS USUAL BUT SAID NOTHING
ATR_09,DON'T YOU THINK SO SAID ZELDA STAMPING HER FOOT FOR SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE THE POOR LITTLE RAT SO COLDBLOODED
ATR_10,I DON'T KNOW WAS ALL HE EVER ANSWERED
ATR_11,AND THEN HE'D WALK OFF TO THINK FOR AN HOUR OR MORE
ATR_12,ABOUT WHETHER HE WOULD STAY IN HIS HOLE IN THE GROUND OR GO UP INTO THE LOFT
ATR_13,ONE NIGHT THE RATS HEARD A LOUD NOISE
ATR_14,THEY LIVED IN A VERY DARK AND DREARY OLD PLACE
ATR_15,THE ROOF LET THE RAIN COME WASHING IN
ATR_16,MAKING SHALLOW POOLS ON THE MUDDY FLOOR. 
ATR_17,THE BEAMS AND RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN THROUGH
ATR_18,SO EVENTUALLY THE WHOLE STRUCTURE WAS QUITE UNSAFE
ATR_19,AT LAST ONE OF THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND THE BEAMS FELL DOWN. 
ATR_20,THE WALLS SHOOK AND THE CEILING COLLAPSED WITH A LOUD BANG
ATR_21,THE RATS SHRIEKED AND THEIR FUR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
ATR_22,THIS WON'T DO SAID THEIR LEADER WITH A SCOWL
ATR_23,WE CAN'T STAY COOPED UP HERE ANY LONGER. 
ATR_24,SO HE SENT OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
ATR_25,A LITTLE LATER ON IN THE EVENING THEY CAME BACK 
ATR_26,HAVING FOUND AN OLD-FASHIONED BARN NEAR A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE WOULD BE ROOM 
ATR_27,BOARD AND FOOD FOR ALL OF THEM. 
ATR_28,THERE THEY SAW A KINDLY MARE NAMED ALBERTA 
ATR_29,A COW AND SOME BIRDS IN THE GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE IN THE MIDDLE. 
ATR_30,THE LEADER GAVE THE ORDER AT ONCE COMPANY FALL IN. 
ATR_31,THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR HOLES RIGHT AWAY AND THE SAD MOB STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
ATR_32,JUST THEN THE OLD RAT CAUGHT SIGHT OF YOUNG ARTHUR
ATR_33,HE WASN'T IN THE LINE AND HE WASN'T EXACTLY OUTSIDE IT 
ATR_34,HE STOOD JUST NEARBY EARS PRICKED. 
ATR_35,COME ON GET IN LINE GROWLED THE OLD RODENT UNAMUSED. 
ATR_36,YOU ARE COMING TOO AREN’T YOU
ATR_37,I DON'T KNOW SAID ARTHUR CALMLY. 
ATR_38,WHY THE IDEA OF IT YOU DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE HERE ANYMORE DO YOU 
ATR_39,I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED. 
ATR_40,THE ROOF MAY NOT FALL DOWN YET. 
ATR_41,WELL SAID THE OLD RAT YOU WOULD BE STUPID NOT TO JOIN US. 
ATR_42,THEN HE TURNED TO THE ASSEMBLED GROUP AND SHOUTED 
ATR_43,RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH 
ATR_44,AND THE LONG LINE MARCHED OUT OF THE BARN WHILE THE YOUNG RAT WATCHED THEM
ATR_45,I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID TO HIMSELF 
ATR_46,BUT THEN AGAIN PERHAPS I WON'T 
ATR_47,IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE. 
ATR_48,I GUESS I'LL GO BACK TO MY HOLE UNDER THE LOG FOR A WHILE BEFORE I MAKE UP MY MIND
ATR_49,BUT DURING THE NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH. 
ATR_50,DOWN CAME BEAMS RAFTERS JOISTS — THE WHOLE BUSINESS IN A PILE OF RUBBLE
ATR_51,NEXT MORNING THERE WAS A FOGGY DEW. 
ATR_52,SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RAN TO THE BARN AND A MAN IN BOOTS CAME TO VIEW THE DAMAGE. 
ATR_53,IT SEEMED ODD THAT THE OLD BUILDING WAS NOT HAUNTED BY RATS. 
ATR_54,BUT AT LAST ONE OF THE CHILDREN HAPPENED TO NUDGE A BOARD AND HE SAW A PUNY RAT 
ATR_55,QUITE DEAD TAIL HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE. 
ATR_56,THUS THE COWARD GOT HIS DUE AND THERE WAS NO MOURNING FOR HIM
