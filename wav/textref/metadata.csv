ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A YOUNG RAT NAMED ARTHUR WHO COULDN'T MAKE UP HIS MIND
WHENEVER THE OTHER RATS ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT HUNTING WITH THEM HE WOULD ANSWER IN A SOFT VOICE I DON'T KNOW. 
AND WHEN THEY SAID WOULD YOU RATHER STAY INSIDE HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO EITHER. 
HE'D ALWAYS AVOID MAKING A CHOICE
ONE FINE DAY HIS AUNT ZELDA APPEALED TO HIM NOW LOOK HERE
NO ONE IS GOING TO CARE ABOUT YOU IF YOU CARRY ON LIKE THIS
YOU HAVE NO MORE MIND OF YOUR OWN THAN A GREASY OLD BLADE OF GRASS 
ARTHUR COUGHED AND LOOKED WISE AS USUAL BUT SAID NOTHING
DON'T YOU THINK SO SAID ZELDA STAMPING HER FOOT FOR SHE COULDN'T BEAR TO SEE THE POOR LITTLE RAT SO COLDBLOODED
I DON'T KNOW WAS ALL HE EVER ANSWERED
AND THEN HE'D WALK OFF TO THINK FOR AN HOUR OR MORE
ABOUT WHETHER HE WOULD STAY IN HIS HOLE IN THE GROUND OR GO UP INTO THE LOFT
ONE NIGHT THE RATS HEARD A LOUD NOISE
THEY LIVED IN A VERY DARK AND DREARY OLD PLACE
THE ROOF LET THE RAIN COME WASHING IN
MAKING SHALLOW POOLS ON THE MUDDY FLOOR. 
THE BEAMS AND RAFTERS WERE ALL ROTTEN THROUGH
SO EVENTUALLY THE WHOLE STRUCTURE WAS QUITE UNSAFE
AT LAST ONE OF THE JOISTS GAVE WAY AND THE BEAMS FELL DOWN. 
THE WALLS SHOOK AND THE CEILING COLLAPSED WITH A LOUD BANG
THE RATS SHRIEKED AND THEIR FUR STOOD ON END WITH FEAR AND HORROR
THIS WON'T DO SAID THEIR LEADER WITH A SCOWL
WE CAN'T STAY COOPED UP HERE ANY LONGER. 
SO HE SENT OUT SCOUTS TO SEARCH FOR A NEW HOME
A LITTLE LATER ON IN THE EVENING THEY CAME BACK 
HAVING FOUND AN OLD-FASHIONED BARN NEAR A STONE HOUSE WHERE THERE WOULD BE ROOM 
BOARD AND FOOD FOR ALL OF THEM. 
THERE THEY SAW A KINDLY MARE NAMED ALBERTA 
A COW AND SOME BIRDS IN THE GARDEN WITH AN ELM TREE IN THE MIDDLE. 
THE LEADER GAVE THE ORDER AT ONCE COMPANY FALL IN. 
THE RATS CRAWLED OUT OF THEIR HOLES RIGHT AWAY AND THE SAD MOB STOOD ON THE FLOOR IN A LONG LINE
JUST THEN THE OLD RAT CAUGHT SIGHT OF YOUNG ARTHUR
HE WASN'T IN THE LINE AND HE WASN'T EXACTLY OUTSIDE IT 
HE STOOD JUST NEARBY EARS PRICKED. 
COME ON GET IN LINE GROWLED THE OLD RODENT UNAMUSED. 
YOU ARE COMING TOO AREN’T YOU
I DON'T KNOW SAID ARTHUR CALMLY. 
WHY THE IDEA OF IT YOU DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE HERE ANYMORE DO YOU 
I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID ARTHUR UNDAUNTED. 
THE ROOF MAY NOT FALL DOWN YET. 
WELL SAID THE OLD RAT YOU WOULD BE STUPID NOT TO JOIN US. 
THEN HE TURNED TO THE ASSEMBLED GROUP AND SHOUTED 
RIGHT ABOUT FACE MARCH 
AND THE LONG LINE MARCHED OUT OF THE BARN WHILE THE YOUNG RAT WATCHED THEM
I THINK I'LL GO TOMORROW HE SAID TO HIMSELF 
BUT THEN AGAIN PERHAPS I WON'T 
IT'S SO NICE AND SNUG HERE. 
I GUESS I'LL GO BACK TO MY HOLE UNDER THE LOG FOR A WHILE BEFORE I MAKE UP MY MIND
BUT DURING THE NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG CRASH. 
DOWN CAME BEAMS RAFTERS JOISTS — THE WHOLE BUSINESS IN A PILE OF RUBBLE
NEXT MORNING THERE WAS A FOGGY DEW. 
SOME BOYS AND GIRLS RAN TO THE BARN AND A MAN IN BOOTS CAME TO VIEW THE DAMAGE. 
IT SEEMED ODD THAT THE OLD BUILDING WAS NOT HAUNTED BY RATS. 
BUT AT LAST ONE OF THE CHILDREN HAPPENED TO NUDGE A BOARD AND HE SAW A PUNY RAT 
QUITE DEAD TAIL HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF HIS HOLE. 
THUS THE COWARD GOT HIS DUE AND THERE WAS NO MOURNING FOR HIM
